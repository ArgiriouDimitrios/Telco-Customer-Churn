**Telco Customer Churn Prediction**
A machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company.
The goal is to identify customers at risk of leaving the service and help enable targeted retention strategies.

This project demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and model evaluation using real-world classification techniques

**Project Highlights**

--Complete end-to-end ML workflow in a single Jupyter Notebook
--Evaluation of 4 different algorithms:
    Logistic Regression
    SGD Classifier
    Random Forest
    XGBoost

--Focus on class imbalance, a common issue in churn prediction
--Clear comparison of precision, recall, and F1-scores
--Business-oriented interpretation of results

**Problem Definition**
Customer churn represents a major challenge for telecom companies. Retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, making churn prediction an essential business task.

This project aims to:
--Analyze customer demographics, services, and billing data
--Identify patterns associated with churn
--Build models that can accurately predict churn behavior
--Compare model performance to find the most effective approach

**Data Preprocessing**
--Handling missing values
--Converting data types (especially TotalCharges)
--Encoding categorical variables
--Scaling numerical features where required

**Evaluation Metrics**

--Accuracy
--Precision
--Recall
--F1-Score
--Classification Reports
